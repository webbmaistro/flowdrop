Writing LinkedIn posts every day? Staring at a blank screen wondering what to say? There's a better way.

Let me show you how to turn your content ideas into a fully automated LinkedIn posting system. AI writes the posts. Flowdrop publishes them. You get your time back.

## What This Does For You

You've got ideas. Industry insights. Thoughts on your craft. But turning those into polished LinkedIn posts takes time you don't have.

Right now, you're either skipping posts entirely or spending hours crafting the perfect one.

Here's the thing. With Flowdrop, you just tell it what you want and it builds the whole automation for you.

<section-header text="Who Uses This"></section-header>

This automation works for anyone who wants a consistent LinkedIn presence without the daily grind:

- **Founders** share thought leadership while running their company. AI turns rough ideas into polished posts.
- **Sales professionals** stay top of mind with prospects. Post consistently without the time sink.
- **Marketers** scale their content output. One content calendar feeds weeks of automated posts.
- **Consultants** establish authority in their niche. Share expertise on autopilot.

## How It Actually Works

Open Flowdrop. Tell it what you need in plain words.

> "Every day, read a topic from my Google Sheet and write a LinkedIn post about it. Make it sound like me—conversational and insightful. Then post it to my profile."

That's it. Flowdrop builds the entire workflow.

Your Google Sheet has a list of topics. Flowdrop reads each one, feeds it to AI to generate a post in your style, and publishes it to LinkedIn automatically.

### Example Google Sheet Structure

Here's what your content calendar might look like:

| Topic | Tone | Key Points |
|-------|------|------------|
| Remote work future | Thought-provoking | Flexibility, culture |
| Hiring for curiosity | Personal story | Growth mindset |
| 3 workflow tools | Practical | Recommendations |

Flowdrop reads each row, generates AI content based on your topic and tone, then posts it to LinkedIn.

## Setting It Up

Here's how to build your LinkedIn automation workflow:

### Step 1: Connect Your LinkedIn Account

Link your LinkedIn account to Flowdrop. This lets the automation post on your behalf—to your personal profile or your company page.

### Step 2: Set Up Your Content Source

Tell Flowdrop where to get your content ideas. Options include:

- **Google Sheets**: Perfect for a content calendar
- **Manual trigger**: Run on-demand when you want to post
- **Schedule**: Post automatically every day, week, or at custom intervals

### Step 3: Configure the AI

This is where the magic happens. The AI generates your posts based on:

```
You are a LinkedIn content writer. Write a post about: {{Topic}}

Tone: {{Tone}}
Key points to include: {{Key Points}}

Keep it under 1,300 characters. Start with a hook. End with a question to drive engagement. Sound like a real person, not a robot.
```

The AI uses your topic and style preferences to write posts that sound like you.

### Step 4: Let It Run

Set your schedule—daily, weekly, whatever works. Flowdrop handles the rest:

- Reads your next topic from the sheet
- Generates a fresh post using AI
- Publishes to LinkedIn
- Updates your sheet when done

The key to great AI content is great prompts. You're not just telling AI "write about productivity." You're giving it context:

- **Your voice**: Casual? Formal? Provocative?
- **Your angle**: What makes your take different?
- **Your format**: Lists? Stories? Hot takes?

### What You Can Control

- **Tone and style**: "Sound like a startup founder talking to other founders"
- **Length**: Short punchy posts or longer thought pieces
- **Hashtags**: Include relevant tags automatically
- **Call to action**: Drive comments, shares, or profile visits

Each post comes out different because each topic is different. The AI adapts to what you give it.

Once you've got the basics, level up:

### Pull From Multiple Sources

Combine content from different places:

- Google Sheets for your planned topics
- Web scraping for trending news in your industry
- Google Search results for current events to comment on

### Batch Content Creation

Use the For Each loop to process your entire content calendar at once. Great for:

- Generating a week's worth of posts in one run
- Creating variations of the same topic
- Testing different angles on the same idea

### Post to Multiple Platforms

Build workflows that create content once and adapt it for different platforms:

- LinkedIn for professional insights
- Twitter/X for quick takes
- Your company Slack for internal sharing

<section-header text="Common Questions"></section-header>

### Do I need to know how to code?

Not at all. You describe what you want in plain English. "Read my Google Sheet and post each topic to LinkedIn with AI-generated content." Flowdrop's AI builds the workflow.

### Can I review posts before they go live?

Yes. Use a manual trigger instead of a schedule, or set up an approval step. Run the workflow, check the AI-generated post, then approve it to publish.

### Will my posts sound robotic?

Only if you give the AI robotic instructions. The more context you provide about your voice, style, and perspective, the more authentic the output. Include example posts you've written before.

### Can I post to my company page?

Absolutely. Just provide your LinkedIn Organization ID and posts go to your company page instead of your personal profile.

### How often should I post?

That's up to you. Set the schedule to post daily, every few days, or weekly. The automation runs on whatever cadence you choose.

## Why This Beats Other Tools

Most social media schedulers make you:

- Write all the posts yourself
- Learn complex interfaces
- Pay per connected account
- Juggle multiple tools for AI + scheduling

Flowdrop is different. You chat. AI generates. LinkedIn publishes. One tool does everything.

No more:

- Writer's block staring at blank screens
- Inconsistent posting schedules
- Hours spent on content creation
- Complicated tool configurations

<section-header text="Real Talk"></section-header>

LinkedIn rewards consistency. But most people can't post consistently because life gets busy.

Automation isn't about being fake. It's about showing up reliably. Your ideas, your insights—just delivered on a schedule that actually works.

Your audience doesn't care if you wrote the post at 6am or if AI helped you draft it. They care if it's valuable.
